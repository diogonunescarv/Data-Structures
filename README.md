# Data Structures

This repository aims to take notes on topics learned during the Data Structures course. In this context, you will find my notes and implementations (in C++) of different structures, providing a record of all my studies for easy review of the entire content.

**Attention:** 

1. Some of the code is still in Portuguese; however, I'm working on translating all of it.

### Future Ideas: 

1. Revisit the code with the goal of optimizing it.
2. Implement the algorithms in different programming languages.
