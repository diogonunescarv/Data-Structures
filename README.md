# Data Structures

This repository aims to take notes on topics learned during the Data Structures course. In this context, you will find my notes and implementations (in C++) of different structures, providing a record of all my studies for easy review of the entire content.

**Attention:** Inside all folders, instructions will be available on how to run the code, along with some test inputs and their expected outputs to verify the functionality of the code.

### Future Ideas: 

1. Revisit the code with the goal of optimizing it.
2. Implement the algorithms in different programming languages.
3. Add unit tests for each implemented structure.
