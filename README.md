# Data Structures

This repository aims to take notes on topics learned during the Data Structures course. In this context, you will find my notes and implementations (in C++) of different structures, providing a record of all my studies for easy review of the entire content.

**Attention:** 

1. Inside all folders, instructions will be available on how to run the code, along with some test inputs and their expected outputs to verify the functionality of the code.
2. Some of the code is still in Portuguese; however, I'm working on translating all of it.

### Future Ideas: 

1. Revisit the code with the goal of optimizing it.
2. Implement the algorithms in different programming languages.
3. Add unit tests for each implemented structure.
